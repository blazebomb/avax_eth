# Project Title

error handling using require revert and assert
## Description

this contract is a simple example demonstrating the usage of a custom error (InsufficientBalance) and the assert statement. The call function ensures that only the owner can invoke it, and the testCustomError function demonstrates the handling of insufficient balance errors. The testAssert function uses the assert statement to enforce a condition on the variable num.
require validates conditions before execution, revert cancels transactions with custom errors, and assert is a debugging tool for critical conditions, triggering a reversal if they fail.
